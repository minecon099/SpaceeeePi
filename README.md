# SpaceeeePi
My own submission to the Astro Pi (Property of Raspberry Pi) for you all to watch ðŸ‘€

## What is this Astro Pi thing? - Explain!
Well it is a competition by Raspberry Pi which is planned to have a lot of submissions from different schools and organizations, including even home mentors or parents, which will design their own code for it to be shown at the International Space Station (**ISS** to brief) and the winners will also recieve a certificate that shows exactly where was the ISS when the program has runned

## Why are you submitting this?
Cos why not? - Even though I have already submitted this, I wanted to share some ideas for the future of the developing history, in this case the future of Astro PI and the ISS
